## About the project
* This repository is an API for the [Video Player](https://github.com/lucasgrocha/video-player-web) frontend.
* I used factory bot to generate fake data in rspec tests.
* To serialize the data to send as API response, I choose the jbuilder.

I wish you like the app and thank you for the opportunity! :D

Best regards.

### Testing

There's 19 tests that validates the successes and the failures of each endpoint

* Run the rspec tests
>    $ bundle exec rspec -fd

###   Some considerations

* My first idea was integrate both ReactJS and Rails in the same project with webpacker, although I ran into some problems because was my first time trying It. Thereafter I decided to split out the React and Rails into different repositories.

* Was not possible to deploy the API on Heroku because I would spend some time to install the ```ffmpegthumbnailer``` on the server, them I decided to leave aside this idea and focus on rpsec testing.

* In production the uploaded video should be saved in AWS S3 (there's a config file at ```Ã¬nitializers/carrierwave.rb``` to manage the storage on each environment).

* I made my own JWT authentication based on Its concepts to prevent spending time configuring devise and jwt from scratch, Its totally conceptual.

* Was very cool to develop the application and I learned a lot of new things! :D

###   Some points that I would like to have made

* Add validations to the models
* Refactor the controllers and Its routes
* Use some JWT authentication gem
* Implement sidekiq to prevent the carrierwave upload finishes to send a response (would improve the user's experience)
